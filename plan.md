# Implementation Plan for HBF - Wails + xterm.js + Neovim Desktop App

## Project Overview
Build a desktop application using Wails that embeds xterm.js as a terminal emulator and connects to Neovim running in a PTY, providing a native desktop experience for Neovim users.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize Wails project structure for HBF project
2. Set up Go backend with necessary dependencies
3. Configure frontend with vanilla JavaScript and xterm.js
4. Establish basic Wails communication between frontend and backend

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Go)
1. **PTY Integration**
   - Integrate `creack/pty` library for cross-platform PTY support
   - Create PTY wrapper for spawning processes

2. **Neovim Process Management**
   - Implement `Connect()` method to spawn Neovim in PTY
   - Handle process lifecycle (start, monitor, cleanup)
   - Implement error handling for process failures

3. **Communication Layer**
   - Implement `SendInput(data)` method to forward keystrokes to Neovim
   - Set up event streaming for Neovim output using Wails EventsEmit
   - Implement `Resize(cols, rows)` method for terminal resizing

4. **Window Management**
   - Handle window resize events
   - Maintain PTY size synchronization with frontend

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Vanilla JS + xterm.js)
1. **Terminal Setup**
   - Initialize xterm.js terminal instance
   - Configure xterm-addon-fit for automatic resizing
   - Set up terminal styling and themes

2. **Event Handling**
   - Implement keystroke capture and forwarding to backend
   - Set up event listeners for Wails backend communication
   - Handle terminal output rendering from backend events

3. **Resize Management**
   - Implement window resize detection
   - Calculate and communicate new terminal dimensions to backend
   - Ensure responsive terminal behavior

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. **Connection Flow**
   - Implement complete startup sequence
   - Test PTY communication reliability
   - Verify terminal escape sequence handling

2. **User Experience**
   - Test full Neovim functionality (colors, cursor movement, etc.)
   - Verify responsive resizing behavior
   - Test cross-platform compatibility

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement graceful error handling for connection failures
   - Add user feedback for common issues
   - Handle edge cases (process crashes, PTY failures)

### Phase 5: Enhancement & Polish
1. **Optional Features** (as specified in requirements)
   - Command-line file opening support
   - Theme synchronization between xterm.js and Neovim
   - Configurable Neovim binary selection
   - Session save/restore functionality

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize data streaming between backend and frontend
   - Minimize latency in keystroke forwarding
   - Ensure efficient memory usage

3. **Documentation & Distribution**
   - Create user documentation
   - Set up build scripts for cross-platform distribution
   - Test installation and deployment process

## Key Technical Considerations
- **PTY vs Pipes**: Critical to use PTY for proper terminal escape sequence support
- **Cross-platform**: Ensure compatibility with Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Performance**: Minimize latency in keystroke forwarding and output rendering
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of process failures and connection issues

## Success Criteria
- App launches directly into functional Neovim session
- Full terminal capabilities (colors, cursor control, resizing) work correctly
- User experience matches native terminal Neovim usage
- Reliable cross-platform operation
